# aeros

An ASCII game written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) with a [libtcod](https://github.com/libtcod/libtcod) [rust binding](https://crates.io/crates/tcod). One of my first actual games written in Rust mainly as a learning experience.

## compiling

### initial setup

1. follow the [tcod installation](https://crates.io/crates/tcod) guide
2. `cargo run` or `cargo run --release`

### credits

i learned basic tcod from the [python tutorial](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/2019/) and i learned how to use the rust binding from [the tutorial i found online](https://tomassedovic.github.io/roguelike-tutorial/)

kudos to the original libtcod devs for making this amazing lib
